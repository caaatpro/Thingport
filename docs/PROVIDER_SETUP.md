# Provider setup

Importing from **Printables** works out of the box (its public API needs no credential). **MakerWorld** and **Thingiverse** each need a credential from your own account before Thingport can import from them.

## Thingiverse Access Token

Instance-wide, admin-configured (Admin > Settings > Thingiverse Access Token) -- one token is shared by every user's Thingiverse imports.

1. Sign in to your Thingiverse account, then go to [thingiverse.com/apps/create](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/create).
2. Register a new app. The name/description don't matter for this; pick whichever Application Type doesn't require a redirect URL (e.g. "Desktop" or "Mobile") -- a "Web App" asks for OAuth details you don't need here.
3. Once created, Thingiverse shows an **Access Token** for it. This is different from your Thingiverse login password -- it's a permanent credential tied to that registered app.
4. Copy it and paste it into Thingport's **Admin Settings > Thingiverse Access Token**, then Save. Thingport verifies the token against Thingiverse before storing it, so a mistyped or revoked token is rejected immediately with a clear error instead of only failing on the next import.

Treat this token like a password: anyone who has it can use it to act as your Thingiverse app. If it's ever exposed, revoke it from your Thingiverse account's Apps page and generate a new one.

## MakerWorld cookie

Per-user (Profile > MakerWorld) -- MakerWorld has no developer API, so importing from it runs as _your own_ logged-in MakerWorld session, captured as a cookie value.

### Easiest: Thingport Grab

The [Thingport Grab](../extension/README.md) browser extension captures this automatically the first time you import something from a MakerWorld tab where you're already logged in -- there's nothing to copy by hand.

### Manual: copy it from your browser

1. Log in at [makerworld.com](https://makerworld.com) in your browser.
2. Open DevTools (`F12`, or `Cmd+Option+I` on macOS).
3. Chrome/Edge: go to the **Application** tab > **Cookies** > `https://makerworld.com`. Firefox: **Storage** tab > **Cookies** > `https://makerworld.com`.
4. Find the cookie named `token` and copy its **Value** column -- just that raw value, nothing else needs adding.
5. Paste it into Thingport's **Profile > MakerWorld** field and Save. Thingport verifies it against MakerWorld before storing it, so a stale or mistyped paste is rejected immediately instead of only failing on the next import.

If there's no cookie named `token` (MakerWorld occasionally renames things), use the **Network** tab instead: reload the page, click any request to `makerworld.com`, open its Request Headers, and copy the whole `cookie:` value. Thingport only pulls the `token=...` part out of it and ignores the rest, so pasting the entire header works too.

This is your own MakerWorld login session -- don't share it, and expect to redo this occasionally, since MakerWorld sessions eventually expire.

## Cults3D

No setup on the server -- but Cults3D only gives files to a signed-in browser, so it can be imported **only through the Thingport Grab extension**, and only **free** models:

1. Log in to cults3d.com in the same browser.
2. Open a model page that has a free **Download** button and click the Thingport icon, then **Import**.

The extension presses the page's own Download button, hands the resulting link to Thingport, and Thingport fetches the file. A zip of several STL/3MF files becomes one model with a plate per file. Paid models can't be imported.
